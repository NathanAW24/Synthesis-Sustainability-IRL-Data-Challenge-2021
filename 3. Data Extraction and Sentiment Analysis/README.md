# Data Extraction and Sentiment Analysis

The files "EventData_Table.py" and "Sustainability_Config.ini" are required to utilize the SQL functionality and local database in python. We created two main functions in "EventData_Table.py" which returns the same filtered tables as the one in the previous section in the structure of a dataframe.

In "SentimentAnalysis.ipynb", we do sentiment analysis on the post_caption and post_content tables for both respective tables and tried to make sense of the data by creating visualizations on the polarity and subjectivity values. In addition, we also visualized a pie chart for the segment_name values to determine which group is the most significant in posting about surplus food.
